# Azure-Sentinel

This project utilizes Azure and Sentinel for A honeypot project designed to attract, detect, and analyze malicious activities by setting up a decoy system or network resource. This decoy mimics a legitimate target, such as a vulnerable server or a piece of sensitive data, to lure attackers and study their methods and behavior. Here are the key aspects of a honeypot project:
  * Decoy Systems: These are systems or resources intentionally made to appear as appealing targets for cyber attackers. They can simulate servers, databases, IoT devices, or any other networked device.
  * Monitoring and Logging: Honeypots are equipped with extensive monitoring tools to log all interactions. This helps cybersecurity experts understand attack vectors, methods, tools, and behaviors of the attackers.
  * Research and Analysis: Data collected from honeypots are analyzed to gain insights into the latest threats and attack patterns. This information is crucial for developing better defensive strategies and improving cybersecurity protocols.

Types of Honeypots:
  * Low-Interaction Honeypots: Simulate only basic services and are primarily used to collect information about automated attacks like worms or bots. They are easier to set up and manage but provide limited interaction data.
  * High-Interaction Honeypots: Fully functional systems that provide a real operating environment for attackers. They offer deeper insights but come with higher risks and require more resources to maintain.
